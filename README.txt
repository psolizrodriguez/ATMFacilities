# ATMFacilities
Spring allowed us to delete the dummy data insertion classes and migrate that data into the app-context.xml file.
The beans were created under the singleton scope on purpouse, to allow the test cases to run one after each other.
The new class diagram is located at the META-INF folder and at the resources folder with the old version.
